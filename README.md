# Deloitte-Presents-Machine-Learning-Challenge-Predict-Loan-Defaulters
14th rank solution

## Description

Banks run into losses when a customer doesn't pay their loans on time. Because of this, every year, banks have losses in crores, and this also impacts the country's economic growth to a large extent. In this hackathon, we look at various attributes such as funded amount, location, loan, balance, etc., to predict if a person will be a loan defaulter or not. 

To solve this problem, MachineHack has created a training dataset of 67,463 rows and 35 columns and a testing dataset of 28,913 rows and 34 columns. The hackathon demands a few pre-requisite skills like big dataset, underfitting vs overfitting, and the ability to optimise “log_loss” to generalise well on unseen data. 

## Evaluation

#### What is the Metric In this competition? How is the Leaderboard Calculated?

* The submission will be evaluated using the Log Loss metric. One can use sklearn.metric.log_loss to calculate the same.
* This hackathon supports private and public leaderboards
* The public leaderboard is evaluated on 30% of Test data
* The private leaderboard will be made available at the end of the hackathon which will be evaluated on 100% of Test data
* The Final Score represents the score achieved based on the Best Score on the public leaderboard
